  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart" style="margin-top: 300px;">
    Gaming often gets a bad reputation, especially from people
    not born of the technological generation, though believe it or not, video games actually possess both physical and
    mental benefits if played in moderation.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
    For one, high-pace video games improve reflexes and cognitive ability, most notably quick thinking. Online
    games encourage pro-social activity which, combined with
    other factors, boost the mental health of a person so
    long as correct gaming timeframes are followed.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
    Aside from that, people use the medium of gaming as a
    source of income! People create videos on YouTube and
    stream games on streaming services in order to generate
    a stable amount of profit to maintain their lives, while
    also having fun doing their work.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
    All in all, gaming not only benefits the average person
    physically and mentally, but also serves as a medium for
    others to generate revenue while also having fun. It's
    important to remember, however, that
    <a style=color:maroon>
      gaming is only good in moderation,
    </a>
    and that there may be consequences in doing too much of
    anything.
