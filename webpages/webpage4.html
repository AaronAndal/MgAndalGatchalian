      We now know both the good and the bad effects of   
    gaming, but what happens if we forget our bounds and
    stop moderating gaming? Here are a few stories about
    peoples' lives being affected negatively by gaming
    addiction.
  </p>

  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      According to one user, they used to play video games
    10 hours a day if the time permitted. This caused small
    shortcomings which eventually grew into bigger problems,
    like failing a grade, and ultimately changed the very
    schedule of their lives for approximately seven years.
  </p>

      He was able to redeem himself though, and found balance
    within the enjoyable benefits of gaming and the constant
    flow of needs and requirements in daily life. With this,
    he was able to use gaming to his advantage instead of it
    being an active detriment.
  </p>

  <br>
  
  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      This next user was exposed to unlimited amounts of 
    game time in their childhood, which would obviously spur
    a lack of self-control and thus start the beginning of
    their problem. Like the first user, the small problems
    that arose from being addicted to games eventually grew
    and affected them in significant ways, like denying them
    a position in the Army, or even initiating a divorce due
    to neglect.
  </p>

  <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Fortunately for this user, they able to break away
    from gaming entirely, albeit not without struggle. It
    took them approximately three months to be free from the
    addiction entirely, and was able to live a happy and
    successful life.

      So, what does this mean for us? Gaming still has its
    benefits, but it is very important to make sure that 
    <a style=color:maroon> you have a balance </a> 
    between gaming, and the facets of daily life. That way,
    you can use the benefits of games to your advantage,
    instead of being disadvantaged.
