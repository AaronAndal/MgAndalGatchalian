      Everybody has at least <i>heard</i> of gaming. From more casual games like Minecraft or Animal Crossing, to
      extreme games for the truest of gamers like the Dark Souls Franchise or Hollow Knight. But how did gaming start?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      It all started from the Atari and one of the vry first video games, <b>Pong</b>. Pong was quite a simple game, a
      ball travels from side to side and two players try to block it from going through their goal. But this simple
      game opened the possibilities to more nuanced games that take the positives of the medium and use it to it's
      fullest.

    <br>
    <i style="background: white;">and so enters Super Mario Brothers</i> <br>
    <br>
    <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Super Mario Bros. is a game that not only defined the 2D platformer genre, but gaming as a whole, though it
      wasn't graphically stunning or narratively briliant. It was a simple and fun game that proved that gaming was
      not a niche hobby for nerds, but a fun pasttime that can be enjoyed by anyone from any race, gender, age or walk
      of life.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Super Mario Bros. also pioneered many popular things today such as speedruns, where people try to beat the game as quickly as possible and challenge runs, where people try to beat the game with as many limitations as possible. It also inspired many games and gaming conventions such as sidescrollers and shortcuts.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      In conclusion, gaming started as an experiment with early computers, and was transformed and pushed into the mainstream by things such as Super Mario Bros.
