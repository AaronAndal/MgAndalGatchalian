      Everybody has at least <i>heard</i> of gaming. From more casual games like Minecraft or Animal Crossing, to
      extreme games for the truest of gamers like the Dark Souls Franchise or Hollow Knight. But how did gaming start?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      It all started from the Atari and one of the vry first video games, <b>Pong</b>. Pong was quite a simple game, a
      ball travels from side to side and two players try to block it from going through their goal. But this simple
      game opened the possibilities to more nuanced games that take the positives of the medium and use it to it's
      fullest.

      enters Super Mario Brothers</i>

      title="Why Super Mario Bros. is the Greatest and Most Important Game Of All Time" frameborder="0"

    <br>
    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Super Mario Bros. is a game that not only defined the 2D platformer genre, but gaming as a whole, though it
      wasn't graphically stunning or narratively briliant. It was a simple and fun game that proved that gaming was
      not a niche hobby for nerds, but a fun pasttime that can be enjoyed by anyone from any race, gender, age or walk
      of life.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      After super Mario Bros, there were a lot of influential video game releases such as The Legend of Zelda (1986) and
      Wolfenstein 3D (1992). But the next notable title is Doom (1993). This game is very similar to Wolfenstein in
      looks and genre. This is the most popular example of a First Person Shooter, it served as an inspiration for many
      games made then and still today.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      After super Doom, some of the influential video game releases were Grand Theft Auto III (2001) and Halo: Combat
      Evolved (2001). But none of these would compare to the impact of <b>Minecraft</b>, this game had a massive
      following at the time of it's release, and still maintains that following to this day.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Super Mario Bros. also pioneered many popular things today such as speedruns, where people try to beat the game as
      quickly as possible and challenge runs, where people try to beat the game with as many limitations as possible. It
      also inspired many games and gaming conventions such as sidescrollers and shortcuts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="float: left; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      In conclusion, gaming started as an experiment with early computers, and was transformed and pushed into the
      mainstream by things such as Super Mario Bros.
