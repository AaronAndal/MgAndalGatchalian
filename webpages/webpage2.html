      Many people enjoy gaming as a hobby and enjoy many positives explained in the positives section of our website.
      But when people get addicted to video games, is it still considered a simple form of entertainment, or a
      detriment that would have been better off not existing at all.

    <p style="float: right; clear: both;" id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that your brain releases to make you feel pleasure when playing video games. But
      recieving too much will increase the amount of dopamine needed to feel pleasure, meaning that you will need
      something as stimulating as the games you play to feel pleasure.

      Many different games, especially online games, breed an environment of toxicity. You can see this from games
      like Clash Royale, who offer emotes that can be used to insult someone after defeating them in a battle.

      Aside from the emotional negatives, gaming also poses physical issues like <a style="color: maroon;"> Carpal
        Tunnel Syndrome</a>, which basically hurts your wrist whenever you move it around. Many gamers gain Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome due
      to consistent straining movements like moving the mouse or using the keyboard.

      All in all, gaming, when not supervised, can become harmful to someone, physically and emotionally. A temporary
      boost in Dopamine that may cause severe and permanent issues that will haunt you for a long time.
