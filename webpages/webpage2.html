        Many people enjoy gaming as a hobby and enjoy many positives explained in the positives section of our website.
        But when people get addicted to video games, is it still considered a simple form of entertainment, or a
        detriment that would have been better off not existing at all.

      <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
        Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that your brain releases to make you feel pleasure when playing video games. But
        recieving too much will increase the amount of dopamine needed to feel pleasure, meaning that you will need
        something as stimulating as the games you play to feel pleasure.

      <p id="paragraphP1" class="paragraphstart">
        Many different games, especially online games, breed an environment of toxicity. You can see this from games
        like Clash Royale, who offer emotes that can be used to insult someone after defeating them in a battle.

        Aside from the emotional negatives, gaming also poses physical issues like <a style="color: maroon;"> Carpel
          Tunnel </a>. Which basically hurts your wrist whenever you move it around. Many gamers gain Carpel Tunnel due
        to consistent straining movements like moving the mouse or using the keyboard.

        All in all, gaming, when not supervised, can become harmful to someone, physically and emotionally. A temporary
        boost in Dopamine that may cause severe and permanent issues that will haunt you for a long time.
